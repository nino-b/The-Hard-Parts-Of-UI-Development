# The Hard Parts of UI Development


## Introduction
Welcome! This repository shows my journey through [Will Sentance's](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/will-sentance/) "[The Hard Parts of UI Development](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/hard-parts-ui-dev/)" workshop. 

## About the Workshop
This workshop covers an under-the-hood knowledge of UI dev by learning techniques such as data binding, UI composition, templating, virtual DOM and its reconciliation, and hooks. How JavaScript interacts with browser features like the DOM and HTML parser.

## Structure
'notes' folder includes files for each section of workshop where I put notes from the workshop, my understanding of the subject and some of the research results.
